1 : HTML elements have opening tags like <h1> and closing tags like </h1>.
    The text for an element goes between its opening and closing tags.

2 : The h1 through h6 heading elements are used to signify the importance of content below them. 
    The lower the number, the higher the importance, 
    so h2 elements have less importance than h1 elements. 
    Only use one h1 element per page and place lower importance headings below higher importance headings.

3 : The p element is used to create a paragraph of text on websites.

4 : Commenting allows you to leave messages without affecting the browser display. 
    It also allows you to make code inactive. 
    A comment in HTML starts with <!--, contains any number of lines of text, and ends with -->

5 : HTML5 has some elements that identify different content areas. 
    These elements make your HTML easier to read and help with Search Engine Optimization (SEO) and accessibility.

6 : In the previous step, 
    you put the h1, h2, comment, and p elements inside the main element. 
    This is called nesting. 
    Nested elements should be placed two spaces further to the right of the element they are nested in. 
    This spacing is called indentation and it is used to make HTML easier to read.

7 : You can add images to your website by using the img element. 
    img elements have an opening tag without a closing tag. 
    A tag for an element without a closing tag is known as a self-closing tag.

8 : HTML attributes are special words used inside the opening tag of an element to control the element's behavior.
    The src attribute in an img element specifies the image's URL (where the image is located).

9 : All img elements should have an alt attribute. 
    The alt attribute's text is used for screen readers to improve accessibility and is displayed if the image fails to load.

10 : You can link to another page with the anchor (a) element

11 : A link's text must be placed between the opening and closing tags of an anchor (a) element.

12 : In the previous step you turned the words link to cat pictures into a link by placing them between opening and closing anchor (a) tags. You can do the same to words inside of an element, such as a p element.

13 : Add a target attribute with the value _blank to the anchor (a) element's opening tag, 
     so that the link opens in a new tab.

14 : In previous steps you used an anchor element to turn text into a link. 
     Other types of content can also be turned into a link by wrapping it in anchor tags. 
     Turn the image into a link by surrounding it with necessary element tags.

15 : Before adding any new content, 
     you should make use of a section element to separate the cat photos content from the future content.

16 : When you add a lower rank heading element to the page, 
     it's implied that you're starting a new subsection. 
     After the last h2 element of the second section element, 
     add an h3 element with this text:

16 : add an unordered list (ul) element. 

17 : Use list item (li) elements to create items in a list
